Upon initially importing this file system into your Java IDE you will be alerted with errors saying your library files are missing
Follow the steps below to remove such errors:

Steps:
1. Once the file system has been imported, navigate to the build path of the file system (i.e. right click the src folder from your IDE and see if something along the lines of "Configure build path" is there and open it)
2. Once you are at the build path, navigate to libraries
3. In libraries, delete all GDX .JAR files (there should be five of them)
4. Then add external JARs and navigate to where you have extracted the file system
5. In the file system, locate the "+libs" folder and add all five of the GDX .JAR files

This will resolve errors.
